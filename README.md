#  Dog-Cat-Panda Classifier (PyTorch + CNN )

This project focuses on building an image classification model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch. The goal is to accurately classify animal images into one of three categories: dog, cat, or panda.

##  Aim

- To **classify animal images** into one of three categories: **Dog**, **Cat**, or **Panda**
- To build and train a **CNN model from scratch**
- To prevent overfitting using **early stopping**
- To evaluate performance using **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**

##  Dataset

We use the **Dog-Cat-Panda dataset** from Kaggle:

üìé [Download Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basukallapur/dog-cat-and-panda-dataset)

- Format: image folders (`train/`, `test/`)
- Classes: `['dog', 'cat', 'panda']`
- Train/Validation split is done manually (80/20)



##  Model: CNN Architecture

```
Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
ReLU
MaxPool2d(2)

Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
ReLU
MaxPool2d(2)

Flatten
Linear(32*32*32 ‚Üí 128)
ReLU
Linear(128 ‚Üí 3)  # 3 classes
```
Input image size: 128x128
Activation: ReLU
Final output: 3 neurons (softmax-like output via CrossEntropyLoss)
Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.0001)
Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Involved
Import libraries (torch, torchvision, sklearn, matplotlib)

Download dataset using kagglehub

Apply transforms: resize, normalize, augmentation (rotation, flip)

Split training set: 80% train, 20% validation

Define CNN model

Train with early stopping (based on validation accuracy)

Evaluate on test set

Visualize accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix

Show predictions with images

##  Early Stopping
Monitors validation accuracy
Stops training if no improvement for patience=5 epochs
Restores best model weights automatically

##  Evaluation Metrics
###  Accuracy
The ratio of correctly predicted samples to the total samples:
Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)

##  Confusion Matrix
Shows how many images of each class were correctly/incorrectly classified.
